2. Reverse a linked list (iterative and recursive).
3. Detect a cycle in a linked list.
4. Remove a cycle from a linked list.
5. Merge two sorted linked lists.
6. Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
7. Sort a linked list using merge sort.
8. Find the middle node of a linked list.
9. Find the k-th node from the end.
10. Check if a linked list is a palindrome.
11. Rotate a linked list by k positions.
12. Partition a linked list around a value x.
13. Swap nodes in pairs.

Try to write tests or small main programs for each problem.
